React Styleguidist is a style guide generator for React components. It lists component `propTypes` and shows live, editable usage examples based on Markdown files. You can use it to generate a static HTML page to share and publish or as a workbench for developing new components using hot reloaded dev server. Check out [**the demo style guide**](http://sapegin.github.io/react-styleguidist/).

Based on Webpack, webpack-dev-server and Babel.
